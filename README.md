# Auto-Splitter-for-Hitman-Blood-Money
Auto Splitter for Hitman Blood Money Steam Version which starts, splits and resets in Livesplit.

This is my updated Livesplit Auto Splitter for Hitman Blood Money Steam version. It reads the game memory and automatically starts, splits and resets in Livesplit. 
It also removes for time without loads time spent during loading times.

The issues have been fixed where the timer didn’t start automatically in A Vintage Year sometimes and the auto Reset option was not available (greyed out).

Now the timer always start automatically in A Vintage Year and the auto Reset works properly so you don’t need press any button manually for the timer while speedrunning the game.

# IMPORTANT !

1.	Switch Livesplit comparison to Game Time to track time without loads (LRT). You can also use this auto splitter to track Real Time (RTA). 
2.	In the Livesplit settings switch Refresh Rate (Hz) of the timer to at least 60 HZ.
3.	In the Auto Splitter Settings there is 120 Hz Refresh Rate option which gives you more accurate splits. It’s enabled by default because it makes sure the memory values of the game have been read fast enough for the Auto Splitter to work properly.
